This project was made as a contribution to another full chess game project. In this project I have implemented a chess bot from scratch using 3D CNN. 
I referred to the ConvChess research paper published by some MIT students for architecture.


# Chess Game
This is a complete implementation of a chess game using React. The game features a fully functional chessboard, all chess pieces, and support for standard chess rules.

Features
Interactive and visually appealing chessboard
Support for all chess pieces: pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king
Enforce standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, and promotion
Highlight legal moves for each piece
Checkmate detection and game over state
